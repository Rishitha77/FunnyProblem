# FunnyProblem

An n × n grid is an undirected graph consisting of n rows and n columns of vertices.

the Funny Problem is to determine whether there are m vertex-disjoint paths from the starting points to any m different (distinct) points on the boundary.Two paths P1 and P2 are said to be vertex disjoint if they don’t have any common vertex present in both the paths.
